â€¢	In this project I have analyzed Zomato Dataset based on Tables such as Sales, GoldUsers_Signup, Products and Users.

Tables:
1) Sales Table.
drop table if exists sales;
CREATE TABLE sales(userid integer,created_date date,product_id integer); 

INSERT INTO sales(userid,created_date,product_id) 
 VALUES (1,'2017-04-19',2),
(3,'2019-12-18',1),
(2,'2020-07-20',3),

(3,'2016-12-15',2),
(2,'2017-11-08',2),
(2,'2018-09-10',3);

2) GoldUsers_Signup Table:
drop table if exists goldusers_signup;
CREATE TABLE goldusers_signup(userid integer,gold_signup_date date); 

INSERT INTO goldusers_signup(userid,gold_signup_date) 
 VALUES (1,'2017-09-22'),
(3,'2017-04-21');

3) Products Table:
CREATE TABLE product(product_id integer,product_name text,price integer); 

INSERT INTO product(product_id,product_name,price) 
 VALUES
(1,'p1',980),
(2,'p2',870),
(3,'p3',330);

4) User Table:
INSERT INTO users(userid,signup_date) 
VALUES (1,'2014-09-02'),
(2,'2015-01-15'),
(3,'2014-04-11');
